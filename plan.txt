Plan:

volcano model values: done
volanco mesh out of values:
create a texture to the mesh:
create normals as a derivative of the terrain at each position
grid -1, ... +1
height function:
    f(x, z) -> height scalar
    n(x, z) -> normal vector
        = (df/dx, 1, df/dz)
        approximate derivative through x + eps, ...
        normalize - don't forget

you can also do this normal computation in the vertex shader
so you can animate like this through moving the vertices
and computing their normals in the vertex shader

np gradient

skybox: 
lava:
insert model into the scene:
